At first, it was overwhelming, but over time I began to understand and enjoy it. Still, I wanted to push beyond the basics. At that time, I didn’t have a laptop, so I worked hard and saved while working as a **bartender and mixologist** at a company called **(The Place)**.</mark>\n" +

            "<mark>During that period" +
            ", I published my first app on **Google Play Console**, called **Coupon9ja**. The success made me really happy, but as a developer, I knew I had to keep growing. The app didn’t bring the revenue I expected, so I focused on solving real-world problems. That led me to a project that earned me enough money to finally buy my first laptop. From there, I started **learning Kotlin in 2020** and have been improving ever since till date, I continue to deepen my skills while also learning **Swift** to expand into iOS development.</mark>\n" +
